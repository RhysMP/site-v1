Contrary to the name of the [repo](https://github.com/phthallo/site-v1), this is not actually version one of my website. Here's a comprehensive timeline of my history with web development:
<Timeline timeline={[
    {"title": "fandom wiki shenanigans", "date": "June 2019", "desc": "I start off doing random HTML and CSS changes to personalise my profile on a short-lived Fandom Wiki, and apparently proclaim myself as 'that CSS Freak' (I do not remember doing this)." },
    {"title": "???", "date": "???", "desc": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" },
    {"title": "phthallo.com", "date": "September 2024", "desc": "You are here. Originally HTML + CSS, then ported to Astro, then TailwindCSS was added."}
    ]}

Web development is one of the easiest and most approachable ways for people to get into programming, even more so nowadays. Shenanigans that may or may not have been along the lines of designing Tumblr themes and character fanpages was how I got my start.

It's also what I do the most often nowadays. Who doesn't really enjoy the idea of being able to stake out one a corner of the internet?[^1] Creating, or at least customising sites, is even common among Twitter users who have "link-in-bio"-esque [Carrds](https://carrd.co) and more recently, [Strawpages](https://straw.page). 
The people yearn for the websites, it seems.
